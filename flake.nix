          # 1. Parse app/build.gradle to identify all dependencies (implementation, api, etc.)
          # 2. Fetch these dependencies (JARs, AARs) from repositories (Maven Central, Google Maven)
          #    using Nix functions like fetchurl, fetchzip, or potentially a tool to convert
          #    Gradle dependencies to Nix dependencies.
          # 3. Make these dependencies available to the build process.

          # !!! IMPORTANT: Android Build Commands Placeholder !!!
          # You would need to manually execute the steps normally performed by Gradle:
          # 1. Compile Kotlin/Java code
          # 2. Process resources (aapt2) - This includes the linking step that failed with Gradle
          # 3. Compile AIDL/RenderScript (if used)
          # 4. Dex the compiled code (d8/r8)
          # 5. Merge resources and assets
          # 6. Link all parts into an unsigned APK
          # 7. Sign the APK (apksigner)
